# 🍽️ Cognifyz Restaurant Analytics using Machine Learning

This repository contains the work completed as part of my **Machine Learning Internship at Cognifyz Technologies (Dec 2025 – Feb 2026)**.

The project focuses on analyzing a restaurant dataset and solving multiple real-world business problems using **data preprocessing, machine learning models, and analytical techniques**.

## 🏢 About the Internship

**Internship Role:** Machine Learning Intern  
**Organization:** Cognifyz Technologies  
**Duration:** December 2025 – February 2026  

During this internship, I worked on a restaurant dataset to design and implement machine learning solutions for prediction, classification, recommendation, and geographical analysis. The project emphasizes the complete ML workflow — from data cleaning and feature engineering to model building, evaluation, and interpretation.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

The project consists of **four core machine learning and data analysis tasks:**

1. Predicting restaurant ratings  
2. Building a restaurant recommendation system  
3. Classifying restaurants based on cuisines  
4. Performing location-based and geographical analysis  

Each task is implemented in a separate Jupyter Notebook.
